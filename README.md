# GMT\*
This repository houses some example code from the paper "Group Marching Tree: Sampling-Based Approximately Optimal Motion Planning on GPUs" presented at IRC 2017 by Brian Ichter, Edward Schmerling, and Marco Pavone of Stanford's Autonomous Systems Lab. The paper can be found here <http://asl.stanford.edu/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Ichter.Schmerling.Pavone.ICRC17.pdf>.

## Disclaimers
The code contained herein is all of "research grade", in that is messy, largely uncommented, and intended for reference more than anything else. It is unlikely to be useful out of the box, but may help elucidate descriptions in the paper or guide some coding strategies for users implementing GMT\*/similar algorithms. 

## Instructions
### What's included
CUDA C Code- this is the meat of the algorithm that runs on the GPU.

MATLAB Code- this code visualizes solutions from the GPU code (output in `soln.txt`)

### Running the code
The code is run through the `mainGround.cu` (for the double integrator) and `mainDubins.cu` (for the Dubins airplane). To compile, type `make <dubins,ground> NUM=<NUM> DIM=<DIM>`, where `<dubins,ground>` is `dubins` or `ground`, `<NUM>` is the number of state space samples, and `<DIM>` is the dimension of the state space (4 for dubins, 6 for double integrator). The code can then be run through `/.ground <file.txt>` where `<file.txt>` can be anything (it will perhaps one day be the problem states, i.e, obstacles, init, goal, etc, but currently is implemented).

### Adding a new dynamical system
To use some of the code framework to add a new system, one would primarily need to add a new CUDA file similar to `2pBVP.cu` and `dubinsAirplane.cu` which performs all local steering functionality. Depending on the geometry of the system, a new collision checker would also be required (if it can be checked with just straight line paths, perhaps discretized to model a larger curve, then the current collision checker should be useable).

## Notes
Much of the offline precomputation is in no way optimized. It is currently implemented on the CPU, but could see an additional ~100x speed up if implemented on the GPU. 

Only a group cost threshold factor (lambda) of 1 is implemented for the kinodynamic planning problem, but an example of arbitrary values is shown for the geometric planning problem in `geometricGMT.cu`. The extension should be relatively straight forward. If using a known value of lambda (i.e., once you decide on a value for your problem based on the desire for speed or low-cost), it is likely most performant to hardcode the data structures (as I have done for 1 here). 

Obstacles are currently hardcoded, but with nearly no speed penalty, these can be added at runtime (as can initial and goal states). 

The collision checker is currently fairly basic, in that it only performs a broadphase AABB check for obstacles. It can however be replaced as needed.

If you're using the code, let me know! I'm happy to help explain any of it to bridge the gap between the research state it is in now and useful to you. You can contact me either through github or email me at <ichter@stanford.edu>.
